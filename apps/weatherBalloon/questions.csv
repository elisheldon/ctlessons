2,"What does the flat part of the ""total ground distance"" graph from  5:11pm-5:46pm represent?",The balloon is not moving at all,The balloon is only moving up,The balloon is only moving down,The balloon is only moving up and down,d
3,What does the slope of the distance north/south graph represent?,The speed of the balloon rising or falling,The speed of the balloon moving north or south,The total speed of the balloon,The curvature of the earth as the balloon travels north or south,b
4,"In the first fourteen minutes, the slope of the distance east/west graph is nearly zero. What does this mean?",The wind was blowing mostly east,The wind was blowing mostly west,The wind was blowing mostly north or south,The balloon had not yet been launched,c
5,What conclusion can you draw by comparing the distance north/south and the distance east/west graphs?,The balloon traveled further east/west than it did north/south,The wind was blowing more east/west than north/south,"The balloon encountered winds blowing north, south, east <i>and</i> west",All of the above,d
6,"After the balloon pops, the slope of the altitude graph becomes more shallow over time. Why?",The balloon slows down because gravity changes closer to the earth,The balloon slows down because there is more air resistance on the parachute closer to the earth,"The balloon slows down because parts of the balloon are falling off, reducing the weight of the balloon",The balloon slows down because it is getting further away from the launch point,b
